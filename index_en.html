          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>

            Based on statistical indicators, the system is able to identify the market trend: bullish, neutral or bearish.
             The parameters to buy and sell are adjusted accordingly to the trend. The system is able to buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest.
            <br><br>
            To explain how it works, let's analyze how it behaves in the three different scenarios.
            <br><br>
            In the graphs you can see purchases (blue dots) and sales (yellow dots).
             Our case study is the exchange between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>Bull market</h3>
          <p>
            The simplest scenario to make profit is the bull market. In this scenario the conditions to launch a purchase are relaxed,
             the profit percentage and the purchase amount increase as there is a greater opportunity to sell.
            <br><br>
            Making purchases and sales constantly reduces the risk in the event of a price drop since the system will have previously taken the profit.
            <br><br>
            When a downward trend change is identified, purchases are decreased, as can be seen in the final part of the graph.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/mercadoAlcista.jpg" width=100%>
          <h3>Neutral market</h3>
          <p>
            In a neutral scenario, the entry and exit points of the market are very similar. The graph shows that at the beginning and the end of the period the price is around 0.031.
            <br><br>
            With a traditional approach this scenario does not make any profit, however, with our strategy the system takes advantage of the minimums and maximums presented during the period.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/mercadoNeutro.jpg" width=100%>
          <h3>Bearish market</h3>
          <p>
            In this scenario, the system has detected a change in trend at the beginning of the period, therefore the purchase conditions become stricter, the purchase amount and
             the profit percentage decreases.
            <br><br>
            The graph shows how even with a bearish market the system manages to make a profit. The unsold amount gives us a price
             average between the maximum and minimum point. The average price plus the earnings obtained decrease the difference with the initial price.
            <br><br>
            In this case, the price decreased from the highest point 0.0275 to 0.0232, which represents an approximate variation of 15%.
            <br>
            Thanks to the strategy, the difference between the price
             average plus earnings in relation to the initial price are reduced by approximately 3: 1.
             <br>
             In this case around 5% instead of 15%.
             These measures allow us to manage market volatility.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/mercadoBajista.jpg" width=100%>
          <h3>Full period</h3>
          <p>
            Let's see what the market looks like in the time period that contains the three scenarios. We can see how activity decreases in a bear market and reactivates when prices rise.

            The first version of the system was released in May 2019. We have defined a case study which is maintained with a fixed amount, that is,
             no funds have been added nor withdrawn, to measure its performance.
            <br><br>
            The initial amount was 2700 usdt**, <strong>profit of around 130% has been obtained, that is, 7% per month on average.
            <br>
            These are excelent results and everything is fully automated!

            <!--
            The system has been constantly improving, therefore, even better results are expected in the near future.
            In addition to the improvements added since 2019 in the operation of the system, there are two measures in particular that can significantly improve results:-->
            <ul>
              <li><i class="icofont-rounded-right"></i>
                The results shown have been obtained from exchanging cryptocurrencies for usdt, however, if the exchange is made against bitcoin the gains may further improve.
                <br>
                 For example, if you have 10 btc, with a value of 1 usdt each and you exchange them for another currency that gives you a 20% profit at the end you will have 12 btc.
                 If every btc increases its value to 2 usdt, you will have a total of 24 usdt.
                <br><br>
                  Trading against bitcoin involves extra risk.
                 The goal is to find a balance. We can achieve it by exchanging some cryptocurrency against usdt, and other against bitcoin.
              </li>
              <!--
            <li><i class="icofont-rounded-right"></i>
              Leverage tests have been carried out, that is, if you have 10 usdt, Binance can lend you 10 usdt more, in this case you would have a leverage of 2: 1.
              <br><br>
              This measure can increase profits, but also risk. For this reason, a leverage of less than or equal to 50% of the available funds is recommended.
               If you have a total of 10 usdt you will take 5 usdt of leverage, which will allow you to trade as if you had 15 usdt in total.
               Again the goal is to find a balance between maximizing profits and controlling risk.
            </li>-->
          </ul>

            <br>
                <i>*This measure is optional, tests have been carried out showing an improvement in the results.
